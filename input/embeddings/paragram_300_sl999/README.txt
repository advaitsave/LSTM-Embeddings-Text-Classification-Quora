Paragram-sl999 vectors

These are 300 dimensional Paragram embeddings tuned on the SimLex999 dataet. They achieve
human-level performance on both SimLex999 and WS353 datasets.


paragram_300_sl999.txt : embeddings, each line is an embedding for the token at the
                            beginning of the line
